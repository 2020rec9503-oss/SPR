This is the code to simulate and compute the SPR performance matrices. The Transfer matrix mathod (TMM) is utilized to mathematical modelled the SPR structure.
Method
Initialize inputs:
I)        [λ, θ range, n_layer, d_layer]  
II)       Loop over θ values 
III)      Convert θ → radians  & Compute k0, kx
IV)       For each layer j  
             - Compute kz1, kz2    
             - Fresnel r, t 
V)       Compute r_total =  M(2,1)/M(1,1) & Reflectivity R=|r|²
    
Visulazation of results
  Plot Reflectivity vs θ curve .

The model assumes all the layers are smooth and homogenous.
